Requires
- background research/writing
- specific research/writing
- programming

It would make sense to categorise by subtopics to research/implement/write up.
So far, ideas for subcategories include:

- use of gray codes
- hadamard codes
- hamming codes
- polynomial codes?
- general brute sieve approach

- a look at BK trees or other programmatic approaches

- possible applications of circle packing
- string distance and the relevance of this

Some categories may also require independent application to base-4. A general
base 2 to base 4 approach can also be formulated but some approached may lend
themselves to a specific application (see hamming codes).

# December
- Have completed research on string distances and find relevant literature
# January
- Have researched and written up string distances / the premise in terms of DNA codes
# February
- Have implemented the code to find different distance metrics and apply this to a pool of codes (sieve)
# March
- Have done more research on Hamming codes, and have independently generalised to base-4
# April
- Have implemented Hamming codes
# May
- Do research on Hadamard codes, gray codes, and polynomial codes
# June
- Have implemented these.
