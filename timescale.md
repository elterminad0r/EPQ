Requires
- background research/writing
- specific research/writing
- programming

It would make sense to categorise by subtopics to research/implement/write up.
So far, ideas for subcategories include:

- use of gray codes
- hadamard codes
- hamming codes
- polynomial codes?
- general brute sieve approach

- a look at BK trees or other programmatic approaches

- possible applications of circle packing
- string distance and the relevance of this

Some categories may also require independent application to base-4. A general
base 2 to base 4 approach can also be formulated but some approached may lend
themselves to a specific application (see hamming codes).
